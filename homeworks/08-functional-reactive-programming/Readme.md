# Functional Reactive Programming

**Deadline: 21.05.2021 23:59 Minsk**

## Task description

Your task is to develop a simple game for catch cats.

Please take a look our example: [Cats Catcher](https://frp-example.surge.sh/).

What is required:

- Use [RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io) or any other FRP libraries like 
  [KefirJS](https://kefirjs.github.io/kefir/) or 
  [MostJS](https://github.com/cujojs/most) or other.
- Avoid of using imperative code as much as possible.  
- Implement:
  - board with multiple holes (hardcoded or dynamic generated)
  - a cat should appear every second in a free random place
  - should be possible to catch a cat
  - cat catch count
- Define types as much and clear as possible.
- Deploy your implementation on the Internet (free resources:
  [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/), [surge](http://surge.sh),
  [netlify](http://netlify.com), [vercel](https://vercel.com)).
- Have to work on the latest Google Chrome on the desktop (all other devices and
  browsers are up to you).

All other ideas are up to you and your imagination. For example:

- Implement "game over" when a user doesn't catch defined amount of cats
- Dynamic generated board
- Cover code by unit tests  
- Using React or Canvas or Native DOM elements are up to you.
