# Animations

**Deadline: 30.05.2021 23:59 Minsk**


Using CSS or/and SVG, you need to implement loading screen animation from this [video](https://interfaceingame.com/screenshots/overwatch-finding-game/).

In your implementation, we expect to see blinking hexagons in the center and circles with radio moving stripes.

## Task submission

Create a `11-animations` folder inside the `homeworks` folder in your
`evo-ts-bootcamp` repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Create a new branch from your main branch, implement the task and create a
Pull Request to your repository. Change accordingly the `README` file to describe
your application and add the coverage report there.

Please share the link of your Pull Request in appropriate Slack channel:
[ts-bootcamp-common-2021](https://evolutiongaming.slack.com/archives/C01TBBGC18U)
in the thread with the homework announcement when it is ready for review.
