# Bubble Sort Visualization

**Deadline: 17.04.2021 23:59 Minsk**

## Task description

Your task is to develop a simple **Bubble Sort Visualization** app.

Please take a look our example: [Bubble Sort Visualization](https://evo-ts-bubble-sort.surge.sh/).

What is required:

- Use [Create React App with TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).
- Use React for rendering (ONLY [React Class Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)
  and [React Function (Stateless) Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)).
- Use React lifecycle methods and React state.
- **Don't use React hooks.**
- Define types as much and clear as possible.
- Implement bubble sort algorithm and visualize it.
- Deploy your implementation on the Internet (free resources:
  [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/), [surge](http://surge.sh),
  [netlify](http://netlify.com), [vercel](https://vercel.com)).
- Have to work on the latest Google Chrome on the desktop (all other devices and
  browsers are up to you).

Required app options:

- Ability to generate array of random length with random values.
- Ability to watch changes while sorting an array.
- Ability to see the status of the app (sorting in progress, sorted or what you wish to add).

All other ideas are up to you and your imagination. For example:

- Ability to go step by step manually.
- Ability to pause the visualization.
- Ability to customize the interval.

And anything you want to implement.
