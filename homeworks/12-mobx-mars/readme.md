# Mobx mars viewer

**Deadline: 13.06.2021 23:59 Minsk**

## Task description

Your task is to develop a **Mars viewer** app **on mobx**!.

Please take a look our example: [Mars viewer](http://mars-viewer.surge.sh/).

What is required:

- Use [Create React App with TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).
- Use React for rendering
- Use mobx. You can use create-react-app template for such purpose: `npx create-react-app --template typescript mobx-mars && cd mobx-mars && yarn add mobx mobx-react-lite`
- Implement:
  - select sols
  - keep fetched data from nasa api in mobx-store
  - add to favourites
  - remove from favourites
- Define types as much and clear as possible.
- Deploy your implementation on the Internet (free resources:
  [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/), [surge](http://surge.sh),
  [netlify](http://netlify.com), [vercel](https://vercel.com)).
- Have to work on the latest Google Chrome on the desktop (all other devices and
  browsers are up to you).

To implement this application, you need to sign up on [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/), and you need to use API part "Mars Rover Photos." All requests should include your API key from NASA.


All other ideas are up to you and your imagination. For example:

- Ability to zoom photos by click
- Ability to choose other rovers.

And anything you want to implement.
