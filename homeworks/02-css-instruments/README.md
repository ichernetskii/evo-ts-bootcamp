# Homework

**Deadline: 18.04.2021 23:59 Minsk**

1. Play games [https://flexboxfroggy.com]() and [http://cssgridgarden.com]() to
   master your flexbox and grid skills
2. Create a calendar layout using CSS Grid
   [https://codesandbox.io/s/layout-practice-uwty8]()
3. (optional, but extra plus) Make the layout of Yandex.Images
   ([https://yandex.by/images/search?text=%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%83%D1%82&nl=1&source=morda]())
   using anything you like. You could use Flexbox, Grid, JS, React, Typescript,
   whatever. For CSS I would recommend to use CSS Modules or Styled Components
   for some extra practice. You could download and serve the images or use an
   existing API (e.g. unsplash) for your gallery.
